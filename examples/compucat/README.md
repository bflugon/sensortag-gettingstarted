# COMPUCAT

Introducing COMPUCAT 2.0!

The COMPUCAT you all like and love is back with updated features.

	- Some people might call Electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) bullshit, humans can not sense magentic fields, but COMPUCAT can. Leave a magnet close to COMPUCAT and begins to complain (Just like Gro Harlem Brundtland)
	- COMPUCAT can now sence alitude. Rise the COMPUCAT up high or put it on the floor and witness a witty remark from beloved electronic cat

Say hi to COMPUCAT! 

Remember Tamagochi from your childhood? Miss it? Don't be sad! COMPUCAT IS HERE!

COMPUCAT likes to be near you. Leave COMPUCAT out in the cold, and COMPUCAT will request a hug.

COMPUCAT is also a light sensitive little creature. Too much light hurts COMPUCAT'S sensors, and darkness may confuse COMPUCAT and make COMPUCAT think it is night, even when it is not. 

Be careful with moving around COMPUCAT. COMPUCAT likes a rocket ride, but not for long. COMPUCAT easily gets scared and nauseous, and might throw up. COMPUCAT might even DIE! :( 

Now, leave COMPUCAT and let COMPUCAT get some sleep. Zzz.
